    /* Pseudocode time!
    We need this program to do the following:


    1. Create an array of all letters in the alphabet, A - Z
    2. Create variables for:
        User Guess
        Computer Guess
        Games Won
        Games Lost
        Game Count
        Amount of Guesses Left
    3. Create a script that will detect the User's input
    4. Check if the User's input is a legal input (can only input A - Z, no numbers, no symbols)
    5. Have the Computer randomly select a letter from the Alphabet array
    6. Check whether the User's guess is the same as the Computer's guess
    6a. If the guesses are the same, User wins! Wins goes up by 1
    6b. If the guesses are different, Computer wins! Losses goes up by 1, and the Guesses Left goes down by 1.
    7. Have some text display on the HTML on the screen:
        "You guessed: <UserGuess>"
        "Computer chose: <CoputerGuess>"
        "You Won/You Lost!"
    8. Reset the game once they reach 3 wins?
