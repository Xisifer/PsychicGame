    /* Pseudocode time!
    We need this program to do the following:


    1. Create an array of all letters in the alphabet, A - Z
    2. Create variables for:
        User Guess
        Computer Guess
        Games Won
        Games Lost
        Amount of Guesses Left
    3. Create a script that will detect the User's input
    4. Check if the User's input is a legal input (can only input A - Z, no numbers, no symbols)
    5. Have the Computer randomly select a letter from the Alphabet array
    6. Check whether the User's guess is the same as the Computer's guess
    6a. If the guesses are the same, User wins! Wins goes up by 1
    6b. If the guesses are different, Computer wins! Losses goes up by 1, and the Guesses Left goes down by 1.
    7. Have some text display on the HTML on the screen:
        "You guessed: <UserGuess>"
        "Computer chose: <CoputerGuess>"
        "You Won/You Lost!"
    8. Reset the game once they reach 3 wins?

// This is the array of all alphabet letters A - Z
    var computerChoices = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", 
    "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", 
    "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"];

/* These are the variables for Games Won, Games Lost, Game Count 
and Guesses Left */
    var wins = 0;
    var losses = 0;
    // var game = 0;
    var guessesLeft = 5;
// This sets the HTML elements to be equal to the related variables. So in 
// this instance, the HTML span element "displayWins" is being set equal
// to the declared variable "wins". 
    displayWins.textContent = wins;
    displayLosses.textContent = losses;
    displayGuesses.textContent = guessesLeft;

      // Randomly chooses a choice from the options array. This is the Computer's guess.
      var computerGuess = computerChoices[Math.floor(Math.random() * computerChoices.length)];  

// This script detects the user's input
document.onkeydown = function(event) {
    var userGuess = event.key;

// This takes keyPress, and writes it to the document (through the HTML span, with the ID = keyPress), and makes that equal to the userGuess variable.
// Which is also equal to the keyboard input event.
    document.getElementById("keyPress").innerHTML = userGuess;


// This does the same thing for computerGuess
    document.getElementById("computerGuess").innerHTML = computerGuess;



// =============================
//Adding some brainstorming notes from spitballing and talking the problem out
// =============================
/* LOOP! For up to 5 tries, go through this logic.
 Set up a random number generator? Generate a number from 1 - 26. 
 Turn that into a letter from A - Z.

For up to 5 tries, computer asks the user for a letter.
Get a response.
Is the letter equal as the computer's letter?
    If yes, exit the loop, Wins +
    If no, then go back to top.
Assume Loss.

ANOTHER METHOD
Start with a variable of computerGuess
Define the game as a Loss at the beginning
Enter the loop for up to 5 times.
    Set loop counter 
    When you win, set Loop Counter equal to 
    something above 5 (like 12), which will 
    push you out of the Loop
When you get out, check whether the counter is that 12, or something like 6
    If 6, the user lost and used up their guesses
    If 12, user won, increment Wins+

ANOTHER METHOD
Use a function?
    Calls the function 5 times
    Determine whether game is Win or Loss

Every time a variable changes, PRINT IT OUT to the console log. Just to see what happens.
